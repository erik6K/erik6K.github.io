## DSO Project
Individual design project completed for ELEN90053 Electronic System Design at the University of Melbourne.

This DSO has a single channel capable of sampling up to 60 MS/s, with a variable-length memory buffer between 2 to 128 KB, software switchable +/- 2.5V, 5V, 12.5V, and 25V input stages with 240VAC protection, and an automatic calibration system.

## Electronic Musical Instruments
In my own time I develop and build modular synthesizer modules. These projects have led me to learn a lot of practical circuit design and PCB layout knowledge that I otherwise would not have got from University.
