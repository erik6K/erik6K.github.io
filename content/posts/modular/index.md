In my own time I develop and build modular synthesizer modules. I initially started this as a way to gain practical design experience that I was not getting from university, but it has become a personal passion of mine. Each module I set out to design and build brings its own set of challenges, surprises, and ultimately experience. I feel that this endeavour has given me a lot of intuition about the design process that I otherwise would not have gained from university projects alone.
